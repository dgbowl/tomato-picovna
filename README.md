# tomato-picovna

`tomato` driver for Pico Technologies PicoVNA network analysers.

This driver is a wrapper around the [`vna`](https://pypi.org/project/vna/) library, which is part of the [PicoVNA 5 SDK](https://github.com/picotech/picovna5-examples). As such, the driver needs to be supplied with a location of the SDK using the *settings file* of `tomato`.
